    "reviews": [
        "I was excited to stay at this Hotel. It looked cute and was reasonable. It turned out to be terrible. We were woken up both mornings at 5:45 AM by noisy neighbors. The shower was clogged up...the room was sooooo small we kept tripping over each other. The saving grace was the pool at the Loews next door. I wish we had paid an extra $50 and stayed at a nicer place. This motel should cost no more than $99 a night.",
        "Terrible. Old, not quite clean. Lost my reservation, then 'found' a smaller room, for the same price, of course. Noisy. Absolutely no parking, unless you luck out for the $10 spaces (of which there are 12). Water in bathroom sink would not turn off. Not hair dryer, no iron in room. Miniscule shower- better be thin to use it!",
        "Found this hotel by reading over tripadvisor while planning a little beach getaway. Really good price by the beach. James the front desk manager was really fun, he made our stay more fun than we thought it would be. We are going to come back with our friends soon."
